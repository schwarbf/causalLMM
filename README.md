# causalLMM
An extension of the anchor regression estimator to linear mixed-effects models. This estimator protects against distribution shifts in the fixed-effects and hidden variables up to a certain size.

This repository contains the code to reproduce the results from the second part of my master thesis. This is an extension of [Anchor Regression](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/83/2/215/7056043) to linear mixed-effects models.
